# MLattrib
Building ML models for any data set
## CONCEPT  
Any set of attributes that can be formatted in a csv with the target as the last column, can be used for machine learning model building. Supplying another csv file with the same attributes, with unknown targets, can be used to predict at those locations.  
Various models are built into the program
